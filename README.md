## About

> :warning: This project is a POC of a request bot. It was done quickly, and may have bugs.

Infinity Request is a bot that allows people to "raise their hand" by putting a command on discord. Once accepted by
another person, a support category is created.

Here is the list of available commands: 
- `!request <content>` allows you to start a request
- `!cancel`allows you to cancel a request
- `!place` allows you to know your place in the queue
- `!enable` [MOD] allows you to open the queue
- `!disable` [MOD] allows you to close the queue
